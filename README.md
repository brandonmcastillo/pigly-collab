# pigly-collab.github.io
Pigly is a static landing page collaboration project created by a UX and WDI team in two days.

##Summary

Pigly is a landing page created by a team of developers( Jonathan Rosario and Brandon Castillo) and UX/UI Designers (Marissa Kan and Meripet Perhat)

## Approach
Our approach in creating this static page was simple. We collaborated on what features of the site we could and couldn't do in two days. On day one, the developers started off with basic HTML layout and integrated mailchimp
into our site while the design team created lo-fidelity mockups. Later in the day, the designers were able to give us high-fidelity mockups so that we can begin the process. The following day the development team was able to fully implement mailchimp features and style the site while working closely to the design team to make sure adjustements were needed.
